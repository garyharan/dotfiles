# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles that might be useful to others.  Like all dotfiles they're a mix of snippets others have given me and stuff I read online.  I post links to articles or posts when appropriate in comments.

## Usage:

    cd
    git clone git@github.com:garyharan/dotfiles.git
    cd ~/dotfiles/
    chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
    ./makesymlinks.sh
