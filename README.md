# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles that might be useful to others.  Like all dotfiles they're a mix of snippets others have given me and stuff I read online.  I post links to articles or posts when appropriate in comments.

**User at your own risk**

To install git clone into your home directory then run `~/dotfiles/makesymlinks.sh` (might need a `chmod +x` before you can).
